# AI Image Generator and Community Showcase

## Introduction

This project is an AI-powered image generator and community showcase platform.

The frontend is built with React and styled-components, and it interacts with a backend API to generate images using OpenAI and manage posts.

## Features

- Generate images from text prompts using OpenAI's API.
- Post generated images to the community.
- Explore and search for posts in the community.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
